Beautiful world circling infinitely
Fragment of sun marbled in blue

Turning in time and tuned like a symphony
Beautiful stars beautiful view
Beautiful world intricate web of design
Shadow and light playing out on the land
Billions of years come down to a point in time
Setting the stage for the folly of man

Pitiful man
Beautiful world [Repeat: x9]
Beautiful trees breathing the air alive
Beautiful leaves trembling and dry
Beautiful bees moving from flower to hive
Beautiful seas mirroring sky
Beautiful sky
Beautiful world [Repeat: x9]

Beautiful world [Repeat: x13]
