A shower of pure joy
A shower of pure joy
A shower of pure joy 

We'll walk all the way down this road
We'll hold each other's hands
We'll watch all the colors and their fades
And sometimes we'll swallow discomfort to be happy

A shower of pure joy
(Love is all, all we want)
A shower of pure joy
(Love is all, all we want)
A shower of pure joy
(Love is all, all we want) 

For a while we'll stay in the warmth
Then as we know it'll snow
So we'll dream and we'll rest face to face
And sometimes we'll stay there in silence 
Like we never spoke

A shower of pure joy
(Love is all, all we want)
A shower of pure joy
(Love is all, all we want)
A shower of pure joy
(Love is all, all we want) 

I can shine like the Sun if you'll be the only one waterfall 
Where my light will shine on

I can shine like the Sun if you'll be the only one waterfall
Where my light will shine on
Pure joy, a shower of pure joy

I can shine like the sun if you'll be the only one
Waterfall, where my light will shine on
