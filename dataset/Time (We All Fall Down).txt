Time will bring you back to me
It always does, always does
Time will let the sparrow sing
We're safe as one, we're safe in love
Time will bring you back again
Moon by moon and inch by inch
Tie the bow at the end
Safe as one, we're safe in love

Time will bring you back around
Never doubt, never doubt
Take me to a wishing well
Throw us in and sink us down
Time will tidy up the mess
Day by day and inch by inch
Tell us never to forget
The light below and the light within

[Chorus]
You mustn't try to push the planets 'round
It's enough to put your next foot on the ground
'Cause after all you know we all fall down, we all fall down
You shouldn't try to rearrange the cosmos
Just gotta keep a steady eye on the telescope
'Cause in the end you know we all fall down, we all fall down
'Cause after everything we all fall down, we all fall down

Time will bring the sun once more
This I know, this I'm sure
Show us what we're waiting for
Bring you back to my door
Time will bring you back around
Never doubt, never doubt
Turn the echo back around
Note by note, sound by sound
Time will will bring us back, time will bring us back

[Chorus]
