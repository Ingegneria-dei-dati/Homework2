I've been waiting a lifetime in anticipation
I've been waiting for so long
Fighting frustration

You came along
With no explanation
I'm not leaving without you
You are my destination

Waste your time on me
Watch the hours fly by like they do in dreams
Waste your time on me
Both of us can stop tryin' to say the right thing

Now it's only the two of us
What a wonderful mess we are making
Scared of the ones we trust
Our hearts are tired of breaking
And having you near me
Is as far as I want you to be

Waste your time on me
Watch the hours fly by like they do in dreams
Waste your time on me
Both of us can stop tryin' to say the right thing
Waste your time on me
Together we can leave behind the lines of enemies
Come waste your time on me

It's my love and your love
Our good love, our hard love
To come by
It's my love and your love
Our good love, our hard love
To come by

Waste your time on me
Watch the hours fly by like they do in dreams
Waste your time on me
Both of us can stop tryin' to say the right thing
Waste your time on me
Together we can leave behind the lines of enemies
Waste your time on me
Waste your time on me
Waste your time on me
Waste your time
Come waste your time on me
Come waste your time on me

It's my love and your love
Our good love, our hard love
To come by
