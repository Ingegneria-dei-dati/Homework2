Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling 
Do you feel my heart beating 
Do you understand 
Do you feel the same 
Or am I only dreaming?
Is this burning
An eternal flame?

I believe
It's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming?
Is this burning (burning)
An eternal flame?

Say my name, sun shines through the rain 
A whole life so lonely, then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling 
Oh
Oh (call my name)
