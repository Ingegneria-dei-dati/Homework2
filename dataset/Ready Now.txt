Push me pull me round and round 
And I'll think of the rest 
There's no limit to the fun 
Oh, isn't it the best? 
You're the one and the only in control 
The master and the slave 
But let's pretend we are all the same
Not true but kind to say

Think I'm ready now, if it takes brains 
You can crush me down 
But I'll come right back
'Cause I'm ready now, an empty soul 
You take out the hope and it gets even easier 

Take me, shake me, hold my wrists 
'Cause I'm the one you chase
If worse comes to worst 
You can erase me fade away
You don't want to hear my voice 
Go on have it your way
You say equal efforts equal rights
That's all you like to say

Think I'm ready now, if it takes brains 
You can crush me down 
And I'll come right back 
'Cause I'm ready now, an empty soul 
Take out the hope and it gets even easier, oh yeah 

Feel so ready feel so ready I'm so ready now
Feel so ready feel so ready I'm so ready now
Was born ready, was born ready 
Was born ready you know? 

I feel so ready now if it takes brains
You can crush me down 
But I'll come right back 
'Cause I'm ready now, an empty soul
You take out the hope and it gets even easier 

Was born ready was born ready, was born ready, was born
You know
