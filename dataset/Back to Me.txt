You've played your game for too long 
I never thought you'd do this to me 
I'm thinking this was so wrong 
I only live with all that's dear and true to me 
You've hurt me for the last time 
When my heart mends, I find 
You always keep on haunting me 
Let go of the past 
Don't ever look back 
Is that the way it has to be 

Chorus: 
My love, set me free 
From all this hurt inside of me 
Someday, I will see 
If you will find your way right back to me 

You've played me too many times 
I can't believe your love wasn't true 
I trusted you with my heart 
And now there's nothing, I can do or say to you 
You've hurt me for the last time 
When my heart mends, I find 
You always keep on wanting me 
Let go of the past 
Don't ever look back 
Is that the way it has to be 

Chorus (2x) 

You've hurt me for the last time 
When my heart mends, I find 
You always keep on wanting me 
Let go of the past 
Don't ever look back 
Is that the way it has to be 

Chorus (2x)
