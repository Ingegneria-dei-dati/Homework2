Hold my hand Peter Pan

Turn it up, turn it up 
Play my favorite song 
I'll show you love, I'll show you home, I'll show you where I belong 
Hold my hand Peter Pan 
But you can never land 
Love's in bloom

And I know you're blaming on the weekend 
She's got that something.. spare me all the details

The same thing that
The same thing that

If it's hurt that you choose

All in all these words are
Too much to take, come on
Please, come on please 

I do believe it's true 
You want the same thing that I, that I want, too
I do believe it's true 
You want the same thing that I, that I want, too
