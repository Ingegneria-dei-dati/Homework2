I've given blowjobs on couches
To men who didn't want me anymore
Why they didn't tell me before
I have never been sure

And I sat and listened for hours
To boys that I'm not sure I liked
My evenings have passed me by

I have made myself a fool
In the company of men
I have cried in the night
With no light and then done it again

And they always think 
All I want is to stay
When what I really want
Is to get my fix and then get away

Now I don't want to be popular
And I don't want to be liked anymore
I don't want to be one of the beautiful people
Cause beautiful people are boring

I've given blowjobs on couches
To men who didn't want me anymore
All the drunken hazy evenings
And sober days alone

All I have to say is maybe
The smoke got in my eyes
And down the end of the fire
