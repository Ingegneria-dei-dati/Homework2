Tell me who you are now what you're waiting for
Will you be the same after you've gone through every door
Teach me how to play your game and what you want to be
Will you recognize me when you've lost your honesty

Tell me you'll be happy once you leave us all behind
Tell me about the kingdom you've been building in your mind
Never really living is a lonely way to go
Will you ever understand there's more than what you know

Tell me who you'll be tomorrow
Where will you keep all your sorrow
Tell me who you'll be tomorrow
Where will you keep all your sorrow

Can I talk to you and will you listen will you see
I'll only take an hour of your precious misery
I'll be watching you and now I'm gonna tell you why
I don't think your way of life can take you very high

Tell me who you'll be tomorrow
Where will you keep all your sorrow
Tell me who you'll be tomorrow
Where will you keep all your sorrow

Who will hold your hand
Who will miss you when you're gone
Don't you understand
I'm telling you

Who will ease your pain
Who will love you all along
Come out of the rain

And maybe there is something you can show me maybe not
And maybe your cold silence is the best thing that you ever given me
Will you ever understand there's more than what you know
