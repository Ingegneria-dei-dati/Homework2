Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low
Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low

Baby I'm surprised you picked up this late at night
And I'm not tryna start a fight
But I hate the way we ended and the fact you got me cheated
I hate these new beginnings even though I am the reason
The only thing I love right now is you

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

[Hook 1]
I'm just trippin' off that Grigio
It sucks to see that you don't feel me though
Pour me a glass and let my feelings blow
Hell naw, this message ain't subliminal
Aw baby, pour me a drink to get over you
Aw baby, aw baby, I ain't no drinker but it's gettin' me though

I don't know why your father never like me
Was it because of my [?]boy ways and this white tee? Your eye
Always thought your momma was a winner
Considering her only stayed together after all those years
You think that we could learn from them

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

Nights like this, we should be trippin' off that Grigio
Telling me secrets that nobody knows
Pour us a shot and cut the music on
Now let's get started, cut these fuckin' lights off
Aw baby, I'ma pour a drink for you
Aw baby, aw baby, I'ma pour a drink for you
