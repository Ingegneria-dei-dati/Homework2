The drinks go down and smoke goes up, I feel myself, got to let go
My cares get lost up in that crowd that go up, up and away yo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

Ain't kill my vibe, don't blow my high, don't doubt that he from the band though
I'm listening to this song, now I'm up up and away yo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die
Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die
Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

Nights like this, I go all out, up so high, I can't come down
Let me live just for right now
Yeah, yeah, bite me, I'm so gone

Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way

When I'm out at night, I chase neon lights
All of my thoughts start to echo, yeah they start to echo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

So I'ma roll the dice, and I hope that I
Don't take more than I can handle, much than I can handle

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die
Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die
Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

Nights like this, I go all out, up so high, I can't come down
Let me live just for right now
Yeah, yeah, bite me, I'm so gone

Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way
