Nothing can give us back this time we've wasted 
We weren't thinking straight act like you don't know 
Tangled in this games we play with no meaning 
Too late to regret them I pray we'll learn to let go 

I pray we'll learn to let go 
Pray we'll learn to let go 

I pray we'll learn to let go 
Pray we'll learn to let go 

Mother you could not let me go 
Still you couldn't keep me from pain 
Keep me away from it all 
Father it was all out of love 
But tell me why it tears me apart 
Why do we end up with the hurt 

So tired of hearing that time fixes everything 
Mistakes keep repeating I can't make sense of it all 
You're my palm reader, wanna know every secret 
I can't stop trying to change you
If you would take me for who I am 

Can you take me for who I am? 
Can you take me for who I am? 

Can you take me for who I am? 
Can you take me for who I am? 

Mother you could not let me go 
Still you couldn't keep me from pain 
Keep me away from it all 
Father it was all out of love 
Tell me why it tears me apart 
Why do we end up with the hurt

Mother I keep letting you down 
Tell me why it's never enough 
I end up with nothing at all 
Father you would not let me fall 
But why are you afraid to look down 
Afraid we'll end up with the hurt 
Mother why do we act so cold?

The difference it would have made 
To realize we were the same 
And all the good we could have done 
If we had felt like we were one 
You're my palm reader, wanna know all my secrets 
I could stop trying to change you, can you take me for who I am? 

Mother you could not let me go 
Still you couldn't keep me from pain 
Keep me away from it all 
Father it was all out of love 
But tell me why it tears me apart 
Why do we end up with the hurt

Mother I keep letting you down 
Tell me why it's never enough 
I end up with nothing at all 
Father you would not let me fall 
But why are you afraid to look down 
Afraid we'll end up with the hurt
