Tic tac
Tic tac

Run up those stairs
Cause someone's waiting
You'd better run up those stairs
Somebody's waiting
You're so tired after you've worked
But you know you can miss things
It's so powerful and it will take
Troubles out of your head
It's so powerful and it will take
Troubles out of your head
You're rushing

This is the best lover
Music is the best lover
It's the best lover, the best lover

You're thinking in a strange way
You're so afraid of problems
You're thinking in a strange way
You're so afraid of problems
You're afraid of problems
You're so scared about the ground
And what's so scared about the ground

Tic tac
Tic tac

You run up those stairs
Somebody's waiting
You'd better run up those stairs
Somebody's waiting
You're so tired after you've worked
But you know you can miss things
You're so tired after you've worked
But you know you can miss things
