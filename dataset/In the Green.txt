Tell me about the place you're from
Tell me about the things you've done
Tell me what you really need
Tell me what just makes you bleed

'Cause sometimes I can't be myself 
I can't feel inside what people say
So I just close my ears, my eyes 
And I feel like shutting my mouth

But I saw you were in need of help
That is when my heart just melts
When I see sorrow in your eyes
There's nowhere you can hide the lies

I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
How you just lost your path and each fear that makes you act
I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
How you just lost your path and each fear that holds you back

I know how we need to change
How strange it feels to rearrange
What makes you want to just move on
Is why you should be already gone

But I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
How you just lost your path and each fear that makes you act
I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that, 
How you just lost your path and each fear that holds you back

But you could try now, with what you've got
Yeah you could try now, the way you are
You could try now, give it a try just a try..

Cause I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
How you just lost your path and each fear that holds you back
I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
How you just lost your path and each fear that holds you back
I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
How you just lost your path and each fear that holds you back
