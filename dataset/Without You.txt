There's no one who could ever
Love me like you love me
I remember how it used to be
There was no stronger love
And now I can't believe,
I was only too blind to see
That your love was inside of me
And now I don't have anything at all

Every night I think, as time just passes by
How I lived your love and how you made me cry
Now that I find I don't know what to do
My life is so empty, so empty alone without you

Without you, without you
I don't know what to do without you boy
Without you,
My love is in your hands
There's nothing left to live for
There's nothing left to do, without you

Every night that I sleep, I sleep with a fantasy
That you're here, its just you and me
Like it always was
But then I'm left to see that it was only a memory
And what's left is for me to be
Alone without your love
