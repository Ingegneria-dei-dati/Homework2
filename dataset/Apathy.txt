Oh, Apathy
Don't patronize me
I wasn't staring at nothing for nothing

Oh, Apathy
Don't hypnotize me
Once upon a time I thought I really stood for something
Something much greater than my love
If I just took the time to stop all of my talking
Maybe I'd remember what it was, what it was, what it was

Oh, Apathy
Don't patronize me
Wake me up, I dare not sleep another hour
I'm waiting for the mission bells
My greatest fear is that I'll wait for you forever
Still I'll never hear the sound, hear the sound
I can't let that happen now

Oh, Apathy
Don't patronize me
Starry night is nothing like what I expected
Can't let it get under my skin
This is not the dream long ago imagined
Then again nothing ever is, ever is, ever is
