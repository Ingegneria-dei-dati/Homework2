Why do you wanna know everything
Why do you need a plan in your mind
Why do you smile if you don't want to
Why do you act if this is all true
How can you keep your wish inside you
How can I just forget about you
When I could never lie to you
When I could never hide it from you
Even if I'd only give you silence
You would know
What's taking place in my mind
But your world has got the fever
You're killing it with your reasons
Your world has got the fever
And you step on it and don't see it
Why do we end up being so lonely?
Now where have your eyes gone if nothing scares you
Why is this all just never enough
To make you happy
To stop your thinking
'cause your world has got the fever
You're killing it with your reasons
Your world has got the fever
And you step on it and you don't see it
Think I'm falling give me your hand
Think I'm falling give me your hand
Think I'm falling give me your hand
Think I'm falling give me your hand
I was walking when I saw a bird in the sky
And I followed its flight with my eyes
I felt like I could take myself up there
And it just made me smile inside
And it just made me fall in love
With everything
But your world has got the fever
You're killing it with your reasons
Your world has got the fever
And you step on it and don't see it
But your world has got the fever
You're killing it with your reasons
Your world has got the fever
And you step on it and don't see it
Your world has got the fever
It is shaking and you jump on it
But your world has got the fever
You're killing it with your reasons
Your world has got the fever
Your world has got the fever
