She don't live on planet Earth no more
She found love on Venus, that's her word
Said she needed space, time to explore
Now she movin' on and on and on and on

Is it might fault that you're broken, is it my fault that your'e high?
You caught me cheating with my ex-girlfriend, but instead of calling me I caught her

I was like "man, oh shit, my new girl fuckin' with my old chick"
We both bad, so she switched, packed her bags, said she had to take a trip
To the otherside, the otherside, the otherside
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, to the otherside

Can we get back to how it was before?
If I can't have you, at least show me what's in store
And what I've made is [?] come forward more
Then we can go on and on and on and on

Is it might fault that you're broken, is it my fault that your high?
You caught me cheating with my ex-girlfriend, but instead of calling me, you called her

I was like "man, oh shit, my new girl fuckin' with my old chick"
We broke bad, so she switched, packed her bags, said she had to take a trip
To the otherside, the otherside, the otherside
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, to the otherside

She's gone to the otherside
She's gone to the otherside
She's gone to the otherside
She's gone to the otherside
She's gone to the otherside
She's gone to the otherside
She's gone to the otherside
