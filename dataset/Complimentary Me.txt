When I was girl I dreamed of my twin
She shared all my flaws she lived in my skin
She always forgave me no matter the sin
She finished my jokes before I begin

When I got older I asked for a dog

I dressed him my clothes I thaught him right from wrong
I told him to love me more than his bone
He ran efter a milk truck and never came back home
