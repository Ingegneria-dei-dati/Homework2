Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows that the war is over
Everybody knows that the good guys lost

Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor and the rich get rich
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

'Cause everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody's got this broken feeling
Like their daddy or their dog just died

Everybody's talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long stem rose
Everybody knows

'Cause everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
Everybody knows that you live forever
When you've done a line or two

Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old black Joe's still pickin' cotton
For your ribbons and your bows
Everybody knows

'Cause everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bleeding cross of Calgary
To the beach in Malibu

Everybody knows you're coming apart
Take one last look at the sacred heart
Before it blows
Everybody knows

'Cause everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

'Cause everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Yeah, everybody knows

'Cause everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows
