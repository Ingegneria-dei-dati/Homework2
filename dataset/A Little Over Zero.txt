What shall I do,
Just to feel a little over zero, a little over
Now that I'm sadness
Now that I'm weakness
Gonna walk like it's for ever
Gonna walk because it could save me
For my fragility could kill me
Is this the best I can be
Is this the best I can give

'Cause I want to break out
'N just live my life
Yeah I want to wake up
'N find out I'm alive
A saint for each bone
Would be magical
It would feel so all consuming
That I'd burn up just like paper
And my serenity it would kill me so

Is this the beast I can be
Is this the best I can give

'Cause I want to break out
'N just live my life
Yeah I want to wake up
'N find out I'm alive
Yeah I want to wake up
'N just live my life
Yeah I want to wake up
'N find out I'm alive

Is this the beast I can be
