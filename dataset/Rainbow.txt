You are not an enemy anymore
There's a ray of light upon your face now
I can look into your eyes
And I never thought
It could be so simple
You can hear the music with no sounds
You can heal my heart without me knowing
I can cry in front of you
'Cause you're not afraid to face my weakness

When we'll wake up
Some morning rain
Will wash away our pain
When we'll wake up
Some morning rain
Will wash away our pain

'Cause it never began for us
It'll never end for us
'Cause it never began for us
It'll never end for us

You're not my enemy anymore
There's a ray of light upon your face now
It will be all new again
There is something else
Just 'round the corner

So when we'll wake up
Some morning rain
Will wash away our pain
When we'll wake up
Some morning rain
Will wash away our pain

'Cause it never began for us
It'll never end for us
'Cause it never began for us
It'll never end for us

I was looking for a place to stay
Are you looking for a place to stay

No it never began for us
'Cause it never began for us
It'll never end for us
'Cause it never began for us
It'll never end for us
'Cause it never began for us
It'll never end for us
'Cause it never began for us
It'll never end for us
