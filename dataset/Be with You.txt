I notice every time when we're out together
And you see someone passin' by, you quickly turn your head
I try to shake it off, say whatever baby, I ain't blind
Cause I'm not tryin' to blame you, no no

What's on your mind what turns you on?
Cause baby it's okay
You know I love ya
And tonight we're gonna play

I wanna be with you
Turn the lights down low, pull my shirt up slow
Open the buttons one by one and watch it come undone

I wanna be with you
From my skin tight jeans to my lingerie
Tonight I'm gonna be every woman in your fantasy
Ya like that

So put your two way off and light the candles
Put the slow jam on, put the slow jam on
Cause all there is is you and me, yeah

Baby lean back, make yourself comfortable
Take your shoes off, loosen your tie
You ain't goin' nowhere tonight

What's on your mind, what turns you on?
Cause baby it's okay
You know I love ya
And tonight we're gonna play

I wanna be with you
Turn the lights down low, pull my shirt up slow
Open the buttons one by one and watch it come undone

I wanna be with you
From my skin tight jeans to my lingerie
Tonight I'm gonna be every woman in your fantasy

Let me cook a little somethin' for you
It's my gift to let ya know what I'm gonna do
Spread the dough with extra care, add a little spices everywhere
Steam the meat with wine and juices, turn the heat up no excuses
With the eggs, the pears, the candies
Taste the flavors, make sure it's better

I wanna be with you
Turn the lights down low, pull my shirt up slow
Open the buttons one by one and watch it come undone

I wanna be with you
From my skin tight jeans to my lingerie
Tonight I'm gonna be every woman in your fantasy

Ya like that?
I wanna be with ya
I swear I do
You like that
