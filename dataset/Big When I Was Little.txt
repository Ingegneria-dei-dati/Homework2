Can't believe I'm leaving
Got my boxes by the door
Sorting through my memories
Cross legged on the floor

My diaries and scrapbooks, oh
They seem to take me there
I was always posh spice and you wore zigzags in your hair

Would you know, know
Know me
If you saw me
Saw me, saw me
Nothing but hopes and living the moment
Where we were meant to be
Ooooohhhh
Those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking trough my old Polaroid
Photographs
Me and yoooouuuuuu
You always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Jut like Malcom in the middle
That was big when I was little

Oh this box is haunting me
I can't throw it away
School reports and birthdays cards
Feels like yesterday
Clip on diamantes
Makes me think of Friday nights
Leaving after class with me on the back of your bike

Would you know me, know me
Know me
If you saw me
Saw me, saw me
Nothing but hopes and living the moment
Where we were meant to be
Ooooohhhh
Those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking trough my old Polaroid
Photographs
Me and yoooouuuuuu
You always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Jut like Malcolm in the middle
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Like Nirvana and Lauryn Hill
They were big when I was little

Super nitendo
And club nights at Bagleys
Smirnoff ice
Open mic nights and Acne wonder where you ended up
'Cause I just can't thank you enough
Avirex jackets and strawberry ribena
Nike tn's dreams of Wembley arena

Ooooohhhh
Those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking through my old Polaroid
Photographs
Me and yoooouuuuuu
You always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Jut like Malcolm in the middle
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Jut like Nirvana and Lauryn Hill
They were big when I was little
