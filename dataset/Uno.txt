I just want to ready your mind
'Cause I'll still love you when you lie
Don't you be, be nobody, but yourself
That's who I love the most

When you smile slightly crooked
That's your style, don't you fix it
Girl you got a hold on me
Don't wanna play no games, this is do or die
And I don't mind if you get comfortable and gain a little weight
'Cause you're so fine, and just like whine you get a little better everyday

You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one
My baby

When the sun hits your eye
It turns a color, almost cocaine white
But you still see through blinding eyes
You won't judge me, wrong or right

When you smile slightly crooked
That's your style, don't you fix it
Girl you got a hold on me
Don't wanna play no games, this is do or die
And I don't mind if you get comfortable and gain a little weight
'Cause you're so fine, and just like whine you get a little better everyday

You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one
My baby

You just my style, don't you fix it

You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one
My baby
