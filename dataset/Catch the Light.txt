Try and catch the sun 
You'll find it all 
Look at the world 
Try and let it out 
Try and breath it in 
They feel the greed, no
They're not in need

Children, get lost in the music 
Stomp their feet into it 
As they catch the light in the palm of their hand
They're flying 
Looks as if they're flying 
Dancing without moving 
Halfway through the air as our eyes look up at this magic

Dancing without moving 
Halfway through the air as our eyes look up at the ceiling 
Get lost in the music 
Stump the feet into it 
As they catch the light in the palm of their hand
It's magic 

What you found is dragging you around 
You don't talk, you don't shout, no 
Now, you know well what's the meaning
