This is the first time dreaming in these hues
Everything I see is new to me
Oh my darling
This is the first look from this lofty height
Everything is shimmering and bright 
Darling, tonight

And you came just in time, just in time
Save this heart from black and white
And you came just in time, just in time
Save this heart from black and white

To tremble in my own, to brush my cheek and take me back again
Oh my darling
And these are the first eyes to see beyond the blue
To make me calm and peaceful when I wake 
My darling, my darling, it's you
Oh my darling, it's you
Oh my darling, it's you

And he came just in time, just in time
Save this heart from black and white
And you came just in time, just in time
Save this heart from black and white
