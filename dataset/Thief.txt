Don't fall asleep before tonight
'Cause I steal the light from out your eyes
You called me a thief
If I were broken would you fix it
You called me a thief
If I were broken would you fix it

Oh, oh, I know
There's been a change in you
A change in me
'Cause you will outgrow your roots
There's been a change in me

'Cause you stole the sun you took from me
Spare oxygen that I needed to breathe
You called me a thief
You stole the soul right out of me
You called me a thief
You stole the sun and tried to leave

Oh, oh, I know
There's been a change in you
A change in me
As you will outgrow your roots
There's been a change in me

Won't you line up next to me
With your skin as dry as leaves
And if you agree
And pray that no-one sees
And pray that no-one tells your mother
And if you agree

Oh, oh, I know
There's been a change in you
A change in me
As you will outgrow your roots
There's been a change in me
