Past is haunting me, fragments of memory
Disturb my peace of mind
Hours of delight now seem a thousand years away
I was a fool to let you go

My heart and soul are filled with sadness
Deep as gray oceans in your eyes
My heart and soul are filled with sadness
Despair spreads its fingers around my mind

Days of love and hope were followed by aeons of loneliness
As darkness sunk into our hearts
The other one's shadow stood between us
A silent wall of doom darkening the sky

My heart and soul are filled with sadness
Deep as gray oceans in your eyes
My heart and soul are filled with sadness
Despair spreads its fingers around my mind

Only memories remain in a world now cold and dark
Where flowers grew, now dust has covered everything
Crying doesn't help anymore so what can I do?
Torn in pieces is my heart, I don't know where to go

My heart and soul are filled with sadness
Deep as gray oceans in your eyes
My heart and soul are filled with sadness
Despair spreads its fingers around my mind

God, how I wish you back
But my mistakes can never be undone
And I fear you forgot our love
