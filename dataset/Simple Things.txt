How do you explain this funny feeling deep inside?
Makes me smile when I'm lonely, comforts me when I'm sad
(How do you) explain this sweet, sweet smile on my face
That just keeps (getting better) with each passing day?
For so (long) I didn't (know) I was searching in all the wrong places

(Thinking if I) spent more money than I could
(If I) worked harder than I should
Always having friends to feel good (I'd be happier)
Losing my breath in the hustle
Just stressin' over nothin'
Forgetting the real joys that lie in the simple things

How do you explain when there's more month at the end (of the money)?
Your situations tell (you to worry), but you see the flowers in bloom
(How do you) explain the soft caress on your face
That tells you it'll get better with each passing day?
For so (long) I did not know I was looking in all the wrong places

(Thinking if I) played more games then I could
(If I) worried more than I should
Spinnin' my wheels with the lover that meant me no good
Losing my breath in the hustle
Just stressin' over nothin'
Forgetting the real pleasures that lie in the simple things

The sun shining on my face, your strong embrace
Mama calling, daddy calling to see if I'm okay
The fresh air I breathe, enough food to eat
A warm place to sleep at night are the simple things
